# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help



My Second even Crypto project. This app connects to a dtabase (Moralis). Uses react functions. Uses a live API feed to fetch the prices of cryptocurrencies. Aswell as connecting to web 3. The web 3 function allows people to vote on their favourite cryptocurrencies. This stores the vote on the blockchain
